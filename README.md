# HEDTOOLS #

HEDTOOLS is a set of modelling utilities and tools (implemented as portable
Fortran modules, not object-oriented) that have general applicability and
are used for data conversion, input/output, random number generation and
execution logging. There are also a few computational tools. Even though
HEDTOOLS modules are primarily designed to be used in the AHA Model, they
are designed such that they can be used in many different simulation projects.
